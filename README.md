# Tally App

This is my first every piece of real Javascript I wrote, very basic stuff - but we have to start from somewhere! Before this I did many excercises with freecodecamp but this felt like the real first fundemental learning. Before was mostly theory and understanding logic, this was implementation which is cool.
